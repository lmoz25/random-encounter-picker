  "All Serpents in a Row": "A clumsy druid named Erp will ask to join the party at their fire and spend the night.He talks in his sleep and summons 2d4 + 2 poisonous snakes from the surroundingsto join the camp. If the guard does not notice this the PCs may wake up with a snake ortwo in and under their sleeping bags. The druid does not wake up in the morning and amedicine check reveals he was bitten and has been paralysed for several hours. Doingthis medicine check also provokes the responsible snake to come out of hiding andattempt to defend its master. In the stuff of the druid there are 2 potions of antidote(with the side effect of not being able to talk/speak for 1d4+1 hours) and 3 home-mademinor healing potions (one of these is actually a paralysing poison instead).",
  "Bad Hunt": "A (giant) eagle swoops in and grabs a familiar/animal companion and drags them offinto the sky and up and away. If it gets away it will bring it to its nest quite a way up ona cliff. The challenge is getting up there to save their beloved without falling off as theeagles (there will be a pair here) protect their nest and young.",
  "Bad Merch": "Two merchants come up with their cart. They have some minor magic items such as anever-clean cloak pin, and a cloak of protection against cold. If players buy something theyget a weird wooden stick for free, the two brothers know it is magical but they don’t knowwhat it does. If they take it, the brothers, who are serial killers (assassins), will trackthem and at dusk they will activate the stick, which functions as an explosive rune witha smoke effect. They will attempt to take down the strongest character in the group first.",
  "Basket Case": "A raging mad halfling (barbarian) is found sitting on the road, he will scratch, stab, bite,and jump people that come within 10ft of him and doesn’t stop screaming about somebastard who he killed that took his mind and cursed him. If he is killed his eyes willgrow clear and he will thank you with his last words before closing his eyes in peace.The PC that delivered the killing blow is now cursed, taking over the curse this halflinghad. From now on, every week the PC gets a new madness from a semi-permanentmadness table but loses the madness that it had previously until he/she him is killedor the curse is lifted.",
  "Beggar's Riddle": "The road splits in three ways, a beggar sits in the middle fidgeting with some wood. His name is Vevric and he will say; “Oh heroes and noble men, please help me, I am a frail old man. Silver 'n gold, I'd take any gift. I'll tell you even the path safest and swift. Lasses, ladies, please hear my plea! Show some compassion and sympathy.’’. If they give him something equivalent to gold: ‘’Thank you, M'lord, M'Lady! So few of you are not this greedy. The right path is yours, t'has no goons. I hope to see y'all again. Real soon.’’. The right path leads around and after an hour or so they get back on the road they came from, back to the smiling beggar. Silver equivalent: ‘’Ladies, and gentlemen, what a gracious gift. Words must be kept, the best way, safe and swift! The right path is yours, but it is the left. You look like good folk, neither dim nor daft.’’ Copper equivalent: ‘’I see, you are beggars yourselves. I wouldn’t wanna encumber your delves. Straight is the way you want to go. And if you come back, spare an old man some though.’’. This path leads straight into a goblin encampment with which he has a deal.",
  "Blast from the Past": "A con-artist named Redgy (a satyr appearing as halfling due to glamour) will attempt to appeal to one of the PCs in the party, claiming to be a blast from the past. If the PC doesn’t seem to recall any of his vague stories that could have happened to anyone he will use charm to persuade the PC to catch up on old times. At a moment of convenience Redgy will use his dice of modify memory to play a game with the PC to alter his/her memory to incorporate him. He does this all to reap the rewards for being an old-time friendly NPC.",
  "Bloody Surprise": "A heavy buzzing is in the air and something smells badly somewhere off the road. Investigation leads to a carcass of a pack animal covered in stirges who are feeding off of it. If disturbed in any way a large part (3d4 +6) of the stirges attack their new fresh prey, pursuing PCs and horses alike. The carcass belonged to a horse of a messenger, he had some pristine leather saddlebags with him, in them several personal letters one of which bears the crest of a king/council/duke and is magically sealed.",
  "Bluecap": "A corpse of a boar lays on the side of the road, its belly is covered in blueish mushrooms, touching the corpse or poking it will release a cloud of mushroom spores. Targets within 10 ft may make a constitution save to avoid being impregnated with bluecap mushroom spores. These spores use the targets skin to develop into mushrooms in 1d4 days after which they shrivel and die, during this time the PC becomes light sensitive and has disadvantage on charisma checks, on the last day the targets become very infectious and any within 5 ft must make a constitution save or be infected as well.",
  "Broken Axle": "Broken axle, whether it is your own or from a family on the road. They are trying to fix it but could use a hand or two. A small skill challenge of 2 successes against 2 failures will help overcome this encounter. If it was not their own cart they receive 2 rations and a wineskin for their troubles.",
  "Caravan Family": "You catch up with a merchant caravan and with a small deal with the leader of the caravan you are allowed to travel with. For all intents and purposes this caravan functions as a general store and can resupply the party with any (simple) mundane items. There is even a smith traveling with them that can repair armour and weapons if needed. In return, the PCs are required to share some stories about their past with the people of the caravan. One of the people in the caravan (bard/rogue) has very big ears and if the party is even slightly famous he will sell this information to the wrong people.",
  "Cartographer": "Meet Ewen, a cartographer and explorer. There is a good chance that he has maps of the\nregion to sell, as well as some obscure pieces. One of his maps costs 20 gold pieces, the\nobscure ones 35. But he will give you one for free if you can rid his backpack of moths\nthat are eating his papers: a map he said to have illegally copied from a library hidden\nunder the streets of a city (your choice), from a book he believes to be written by\n(in)famous man called Lanne Chaim.",
  "Cattle Raid": "Three odd looking farmers (highwaymen) pass by with a small herd of goats and a cow.\nSeveral minutes later a man comes running along with a black eye, roughed up clothes,\nand holding a rake pleading the party to tell him where the bandits went with all his\nlivestock and if they can please help him.",
  "Cleaner": "A knight in full-plate (paladin) blocks the road, when the party contains anything along\nthe lines of a tiefling or half-orc he (Covric the Cleanser) will demand a trial by combat\nhanding off his cloak and receiving his weapon from his squire (named Jeffry). His creed\ndemands him to rid the civilised world of barbaric and evil beings. If the trial by combat\nis not respected he will use spirit guardians, otherwise he will fight fairly and will yield\nas soon as he goes below 10% of his hit points.",
  "Crackling at Dawn": "You have accidently camped on a nest of shocker lizards. At dawn, they emerge from\ntheir holes (2d4 + 2 of them) and wander amongst the party. Any sudden movements\nwill set them off.",
  "Cray-cray Nay-nay": "They meet an odd druid named Mud. He is a bit scrambled but if you share a meal and\nsome wine with him he will show you a shortcut that cuts your travelling time\nconsiderably. He has ears like a bat and if the word crazy falls he will become really mad\nand his voice will sound like the thunder, winds will pick up, and he will disappear into\nthe twirling leaves. The storm will last a whole 2d8 hours and if there is no proper shelter\nthere might be some survival checks in order to make it without losing one thing or\nanother (Branches in eyes, flying equipment, tents and bedrolls).",
  "Cursed Crow": "A crow starts to follow the party from the sky, sometimes landing and khawing at them.\nThe thing is that to all but one of the players this sounds like a normal bird, but this\none player swears he hears it say ''I will come for you, I will'' over and over again. On the\nthird day the crow is gone but that same evening this player will be attacked by this\ncursed creature in his dreams. The dream involves him slow-running through the\ncurrent environment in nothing but a loincloth while being attacked by this bird dealing\nmental damage in the process, wisdoms saves to wake up. Once he wakes up a dark\nfigure falls from the tree in a fury of sounds, beak, and claws as it attacks the player.\nThe creature looks like a bird, but almost humanoid and definitely cursed in some evil\ntwisted way (use kenku stats).",
  "Daily Chores": "There is a small hamlet along the road, the people living there are nice and although\nthey have no inn they will find a warm dry place to sleep for the night and a good bowl\nof hot stew for some small compensation. For some work around the hamlet (cutting\nwood, milking the cow, etc.) and 15 silver pieces total they will provide this service. Work\naround the hamlet is resolved with a skill challenge that needs three successes before\nthree failures. If someone suffered from an ability drain they may heal 1 point of it during\nthis stay.",
  "Dead Men Riding": "On a dreary day a figure appears out of nowhere nearly 100 ft ahead. A rider in all grey\nsits on top of a barded warhorse (centaur stats, undead subtype), he slowly lifts his\nlance and points it at you. He charges at full speed and coming closer you see dark\nsmoke roll under his helmet and from the manes of his long-dead horse. He will charge\nand fight until defeated or banished.",
  "Deaf not Dim": "You will have to cross a small river, the only way over is by a small boat that currently\nis located on the other side of the river. The gnome (commoner) that owns the boat sits\nin front of it next to a small shack smoking a pipe and fishing in the river. He is deaf and\nhis sight is not what it used to be, so getting his attention is a small challenge. The fare\ncosts 2 silver pieces each and takes about ten minutes. If more than 4 creatures are in\nthe boat, it will start leaking and the gnome will ask for some help throwing the water\noverboard while he is rowing. If someone complains that it goes slow, he will bet them a\nsilver piece they can't do it any faster than he can (they can with a moderate strength\ncheck and a minor wisdom save to figure out how to steer properly), if accepted he will\ngo sit on a bench and will smoke his pipe with a smug face letting the person do all his\nwork while he makes money.",
  "Desperate": "A group of farmers (commoners) you meet on the road are relocating to the nearest city\nas they lost their houses and families in recent orc raids on their hamlets. They will try\nto sell the party anything they have left for some money so they can survive in the city\nand not end up in the streets as beggars: livestock, heirlooms, their cart, even their last\npack animal. One of them is even so desperate that he will sell his daughters hand in\nmarriage for a handful of gold.",
  "Dinner Raid": "Ambush by 4 orc berserkers and 2 archers. The orc berserkers work in pairs and are\nconnected by a spiked metal chain, which they use at the start of the encounter to\nbulrush multiple members of the party in one bulrush (this functions like a normal\nbulrush but deals 2d4 piercing damage if you do not wear metal armour). They will go\nfor downed creatures first, taking them out. If a creature is flanked by two orcs of the\nsame pair, each orc can attempt a trip attack as a bonus action.",
  "Downpour 9": "Heavy rain makes it almost impossible to continue, besides, something is out there in\nthe rain. Water elementals are playing outside but they would spook the horses. The\nnext morning the road is covered in giant slugs making it impossible to travel on\nhorseback and treacherous by foot because of the slime. For several days traveling will\ntake longer as the whole road has turned to mud from the heavy downfall, increasing\ntravel time.",
  "Drag Race": "The sound of hooves traveling at great speed comes towards you on the twisting roads.\nMake some wise decisions because there are over a dozen horses galloping at high\nspeeds along the road in a drag race for some serious price money. They leave you in a\nhuge dust cloud as even more pass. A straggler has fallen of his horse but he is stuck in\nthe stirrups and is dragged along, he will not survive the race.",
  "Duke's Aid": "A group of 15 rough looking soldiers have barred the road with two heavy carts. They\nwill roll them aside for a ''Duke's aid'' fee of 7 gold pieces per person. They can be\nnegotiated with until 4 gold pieces but any lower and they turn sour and rather take\nsome lives. Upon being met with hostilities they will overturn their carts and use the\nslits they cut in the bottom to shoot crossbows from almost total cover while their foot\nsoldiers use a make-shift towershield to advance on the party. If 5 of them die and they\nare not clearly winning they will give up and surrender.",
  "Elementary": "A sudden storm breaks up the day and forces any wise creature to stay inside safe and\nsound. Staying inside will cost them some travelling time however it spares them from\nthe 2d4 wind elementals that will be harassing them on the way (pushing them off the\npath or their horses, playing with their gear and grabbing cloaks and pulling at them).\nIf met with hostility the storm will locally flair up and every round there will be a chance\n(10%) of a lightning strike hitting the floor at their feet. Lightning will deal 6d6 damage\nand half on a dexterity save as well as 6 lightning damage to any creature within 20 feet\nstanding on the ground. The main target is the highest character.",
  "Entomology": "A frightened man bolts onto the road towards the party, he is running for his life. Out of\nbreath he begs their protection and to get him away as quickly as possible, if the party\nhesitates he will hand them a small wooden box. He seems to be a researcher of some\nsort with a notebook strapped to his chest and a backpack full of tracking gear on his\nback. A high-pitched noise coming from the side of the road somewhere ahead should\nbe enough of a warning. The box when opened shows a small glass canister which seems\nto be holding some sort of insect, a knowledge nature check might reveal it to be a bee,\na high roll will show it to be a queen bee... At that moment the high-pitched noise turns\ninto angry buzzing and 2d4 +2 swarms of bees come rushing at the party. If they throw\nthe canister away half the swarms will go off and protect their queen while the others\nattempt to chase of the humanoids. The researcher wants the queen as it is a special\none, rare and quite valuable.",
  "Every Breath You Take": "A young dragon is on the hunt and it picked up the smell of the party. They make an",
  "Farmers Dogs": "Five huge guard dogs chase the party from a nearby farm. The farmer follows them\ncalling their names to stop them from chasing people on the road. They will not bite but\ncome really close, barking with foam in their mouths. They will attack if attacked. If two\ndogs bite the same target they can drag this creature prone for free, each turn afterwards\nthey can drag the creature away up to 10 ft. If the dogs are killed the farmer will call the\nparty names and murderers for killing his dogs and he will cry with their corpses.",
  "Fated Painter": "Meet Andreas du Vavier an artisan, a painter. He is painting the local scenery and he\nseems to do a pretty good job, a scruffy dog lays lazy at his feet. For 35 gold pieces he\nwill make a portrait of a PC, this will take 6 hours and the PC may choose one object to\nbe depicted, a pose, and one fictional thing to change from reality. This painter is\ntalented and supported by The Fates, as a cruel cosmic twist of fate it is now up to the\nDM to make a reality of this painting 3 times, but in twisted ways.",
  "Fluff Ambush": "A tree has fallen over the road and blocks passage. Either you have to find a way around\nor get it out of the way. The only ambush here is your party moving in on the disgruntled\nsquirrel that had a nest in the dead trunk.",
  "Fortune Teller": "They meet Madame Murene, a wildly dressed travelling fortune teller (sorceress), she is\ngenerally in a good mood and will give one telling for free, any other telling costs 10 gold\npieces. She will grab the hand and the side of the head of the one she is going to tell the\nfuture from, magical detection will actually tell you there is divine magic involved and\nshe will say; ''I see a Child in your future.''. If anyone is rude or makes her out to be a\ncharlatan of sorts she will ignore it but halfway through an interaction her eyes will turn\nback in her head and she will speak in a deep voice addressing the rude PC ''I see a fiery\ndeath in your future!'' before snapping back into reality, those that check might make\nthis out to be all a show. However, she will shake his/her hand to apologise for her\nactions and actually curse the touched person. Upon departure she will bestow\ninspiration on all of them. Curse: All saves involving fire are made at disadvantage, and\nsomewhere deep in all fires he/she might see the face of Madame Murene.",
  "Froglegs at Breakfast": "The giant frogs here are obnoxious at night. Their croaking prevents anyone from\nsleeping that does not make a hard wisdom save, gaining them exhaustion for not\nsleeping. Killing at least half a dozen will shut them up for a bit and gets you advantage\non your save to fall asleep. In the morning 2d4 +1 will hop into camp in search for food,\nthey are initially not hostile but will rummage through their stuff and are hard to chase\naway.",
  "Gossiper 11": "A traveling minstrel (bard) has made himself comfortable at the road side at a crossroad.\nFor a silver piece he will tell a PC a tidbit of information that might interest them. He\nwill produce some information about the road ahead or about the region that might help\nthe PCs, afterwards he demands to be paid a silver by all PCs as they all listened. If they\ndon't pay he will be disgruntled and call them cheap under his breath, he will ignore\nthem like a 6-year-old girl unless he is payed the full amount. If he is paid he will give\n1d4 + 1 rumours for free, at least one of which is a straight out lie and the others must",
  "Greasy Situation": "A screaming horse can be heard up ahead as well as the roaring of something big and\nwild. A wounded horse is stuck in the harness of its overturned cart kicking and\nscreaming in panic and pain. A man hides under the cart as the owlbear that attacked\nthem is fending off an opportunistic pack (2d4 + 2) of worgs, apparently you weren't the\nonly one attracted by the loud noise. They are currently busy ripping off fur and feathers\nfrom each other but sooner rather than later one of the two parties will give up and the\nwinner will finish his price. The peddler was transporting pots of grease from the country\nside to the city as winter preserve, his product is smeared all over the road and\ncomplicates the fight as everything is slippery.",
  "Hamlet of the Lost": "You come across an eerie quiet hamlet, over a dozen humanoid corpses are rather\ngruesomely displayed on stakes near the edge. Several ghost(ly) figures are gathered\naround an old tree in the middle of the hamlet, they are non-hostile and will attempt to\nwarn the party about the 3d4 +10 hobgoblins with spears hidden within the ruins and\nremaining houses. The ghosts are bound by some evil magical symbol painted on the\ntree, which, if destroyed, will allow the ghosts to fight side-by-side with the party against\ntheir ambushers.",
  "Hangman 11": "The ruins of a small fortress lay on a small hill. A history check might reveal it once was\nan outskirt guard post meant to protect this road. At dusk, a ghost appears but it seems\nharmless, it is pacing in a small part of the ruins and mumbling to himself, he can not\nbe interacted with in any meaningful sense. An hour before midnight he sinks on his\nknees and seems to be praying and wailing. At 10 to twelve he will walk into the former\ncourtyard, climb imaginary stairs, and at 12 precisely he seems to drop flailing as he\nhangs by an invisible noose. All the PCs will make wisdom saves or will feel a noose\naround their neck that is not there and they will start suffocating where they stand or\nsleep. PCs can be saved by a wisdom save every round or by dragging themselves out of\nthe ruins. Six rounds later the ghost hangs limp for the remainder of the night and the\nstruggle stops, at dawn he disappears.",
  "Harpy Song": "An alluring song comes from somewhere up ahead. Coming closer you can see a\nbeautiful woman sitting on a large stone. This is when the first wisdom save needs to be\nmade as this is a harpy. When most of the players move into the small clearing the chaos\nstarts as 4 of her sisters dive-bomb from the sky. Fly-by attacks are their go-to move,\nattacking only those that are in the open and don't have cover. When they lose half their\nhit points they fall from the sky, if two are taken out and they are not winning they will\nfly away.",
  "High as the Sky": "An older halfling and a younger gnome (commoners) sit on the side of the road, they are\ngiggling while they are smoking something from a broad pipe. They seem to be quite out\nof it and giggle about the PCs that come past. If any of the party have any form of\nillusionary/glamour magic they will see right through it and comment on it\ninappropriately. The older halfling will offer the party to buy some while the younger\ngnome shushes him while giggling, for 5 gold pieces they get a dose of willoweed.\nSmoking a dose of willoweed (takes two minutes) will get you advantage on seeing\nthrough illusions and you don't need to be aware of any effect to receive a roll for it. It\nalso makes you giggle and feel totally safe regardless of attacks or other hostile actions\naround you for 10 minutes.",
  "Hungry Fog": "A huge fogbank rolls in consuming the landscape around you. The fog seems to contain\nhumanoid figures that pop up in the corner of your eyes. Sometimes you are attacked\n(hungry fog or air elemental stats), and the only way to prevent it is by keeping out of\nthe mist. Creative solutions to locally get rid of the mist are essential for survival.",
  "Innocent Lies": "You meet a farmer with his daughter on the road, they pull a stubborn donkey on a\nleash with some trade wares. Disregarding his warnings about staying away from\nstrangers the girl skips over to the party and holds her hand up with a wooden ring in\nit. She tells them they look like smart ''magic knowin folk'', and she asks them about\nthis ring she found next to the road as her father comes over to whisk her away. The\nring actually detects as magic (Magic Aura spell). It is a scam to sell wooden rings as\nmagical to gullible strangers, the girl has some magical talent. She will only part with\nher ''special'' ring for 2 gold pieces, it is how they keep afloat in hard times.",
  "Leery Lycanthrope": "Near nightfall a rough and wild looking woman will approach the campsite and asks if\nshe can share the fire. She will offer to share three hunted rabbits with the party in order\nto secure a place for the night, however, if she sees any holy symbols or signs of people\nbelieving in higher powers she will leave without a word and will be swallowed by the\ndarkness. Although she carries a bow and has some trapping gear only a closer eye on\nthe rabbits will give the party a clue that there is a werewolf in their midst, as these\nrabbits bear no marks of arrows or trapping wire. She has no intention of revealing\nherself or doing the party any harm and simply seeks some human contact that she has\nbeen missing since she wounded up with the curse.",
  "Look the Sculptor in the Face": "A carriage lays sideways halfway blocking the road. It appears mostly intact and seems\nto have been transporting statues that broke when it tumbled. You can find part of a\nfoot and a forearm with a hand attached, the rest is scattered over the road. If you open\nthe carriage, or look through the hole near the bottom, you are looking two basilisks\nstraight in the eyes.",
  "Love Never Dies": "A set of relatively fresh graves, a simple message scratched in a stick says ''In memory\nof Elean and Roberd''. If it is night an encounter will take place with two wraiths\nattempting to steal their bodies and be together again.",
  "Magistrates": "You meet cleric Mindein (level 5-8) and his paladin guard and companion Ornwend\n(level 7-11). They belong to the church of justice and are travelling magistrates. Mindein\ndictates the law and Ornwend passes the sentence. When meeting the party Mindein will\ncast zone of truth and demands each to tell the crimes the others have committed, which\nhe will notarise in his huge Book of Law. Minor offenses they will led slide as this is a\nharsh world, but capital offenses such as murder of innocent NPCs are not. If the party\nis significantly lower level they will demand they surrender themselves and throw chains\non the dusty road in front of them. If they will be a challenge, Ornwend will be hostile\ntowards them. If they are severely outclassed they will let them pass and later send back\na squad to look for them. Murder of a magistrate is met with deadly force and a squad\nof 5 paladins and 2 clerics to investigate and hunt down the perpetrators, or post wanted\nposters in bigger cities with a small reward for their arrest if they fled.",
  "Moonshine Hideout": "There is smoke coming from somewhere out in the wilderness. When you go near, the\nsmoke stops but with a successful survival check you can locate a still slightly smoking\ntree trunk. A successful wisdom check however might reveal it to be a hidden chimney.\nA secret entrance to an underground lair of illegal brewers is hidden nearby under a\nlarge rock that can be pivoted sideways. The moonshiners produce something that is\nnearly toxic called Dova made with some weird herb. It is strong enough to burn a hole\nin a normal human's stomach (as if drinking acid) and is specifically made for dwarves.\nThey say one cup can get a dwarf drunker than a halfling in a keg. The three alchemist\nbrothers will protect their turf at all costs.",
  "Mudfest": "A mudslide destroyed most of the road ahead and turned it into a slippery mess, crossing\nit might not be as easy as it seems. Possibly some mud elementals (modified water\nelementals) around. Some parts have quicksand properties that are difficult to escape\nalone.",
  "Murders": "A huge (2d4 +2 swarms) murder of crows is collecting over the course of 1d4 + 2 hours,\nthey shadow the party in the trees. Anything mundane short of fire will not scare them\naway and upon dusk they attack in a cacophony of screams and wings.",
  "Noble Bastardry": "You come across two young men, one of which in noble attire and the other is rather\nclumsily holding a rapier that is too expensive. The noble (duelist) is exercising his right\nto call a duel, this peasant didn't look where he walked and spooked his horse. The\npeasant is clearly out of his debt but does what he is told as he fears for his daughter's\nlife (who is crying at the side of the road begging them to stop), he will most definitely be\nkilled if this duel takes place. If the party interferes the noble will size them up and offer\nthem a gold piece each to get out of his way and keep their heads when his father hears\nof their interference, in all senses this guy is a prick, but a noble one. If met with hostility\nthe young noble will bravely fight but upon losing (or dying) he or his father himself will\nmake it a personal mission to ruin this party.",
  "Noosed 14": "You pass by three corpses that hang from a nearby tree. A small carving in common in\nthe tree trunk marks them as thieves. Getting any closer will let this possessed tree come\nalive as a hangmanstree.",
  "Ogre and the Babe": "You stumble upon a gruesome sight. An overturned car is wedged between two trees,\nfrom the horse that pulled it only guts and bloody reigns are left, the male driver is\nspeared through by a heavy branch a few meters earlier. A huge trail of blood leads into\nthe surrounding environment, eventually leading to an ogre. The whole road is paved\nwith broken containers and other scattered cargo leading back about 150 meters,\nhalfway there is a corpse of a woman. She is all curled up and bloody but she managed\nto protect a small bundle with a tiny baby in her arms, it is still alive.",
  "Ogre Scent": "They run into a hunting trip of an ogre, they spot him a way off as he is setting up camp.\nThere are 3 humanoids with him, two of which are halflings. The humanoids are bound\nand gagged and dinner, after the ogre gets the fire going he will make a human barbeque\nfrom one of the victims. The ogre has 5 large greyhounds with him that roam the area\nand might surprise the surprise attackers.",
  "Old Mill": "An old mill stands on the side of the road. The boards creaks, the door only partly opens,\nand some beams are on the point of collapsing but there are strange lights inside. The\nwhole interior is a hazard and inhabited by a violet fungus as well as two will'o'wisps\nthat lure the PCs in. As soon as the violet fungus attacks the structure of the whole mill\nstarts to tremble, 1d4 rounds later the mill will collapse or earlier if excessive force is\nused against the structure. The wisps will attempt to cover the door so they are unable\nto leave the mill. The collapse deals 8d6 damage, half of which is non-lethal and throws\neveryone prone, and those that fail a dexterity or strength saving throw are considered\npinned.",
  "One Head Short": "A razor sharp thin wire is tied on neck-height of a medium sized rider/creature across\nthe road. Only a high perception check might result in seeing a glimmer in the air. If not\nspotted the first person is subject to a coup de grace attack causing 11 slashing damage\n+ 3d4 bleeding damage each turn until healed without a save. The next two get a reflex\nsave to avoid the same fate (11 slashing damage and 1d4 bleed, half damage without\nany bleed for a save). Directly afterwards they are set upon by three highwaymen.",
  "One Trick Alchemist": "A female dwarf walks her own small cart along the road. She is called Buggles and she\nis an alchemist and ''brews a bit of ev'rythin''. She sells everything liquid from acid to\nale, from alchemist fire to potions of healing. She will sell them only in threes, and they\nhave to be different. Actually, what she sells is the only thing she can make; potion of\nimagination. She developed a method to incorporate a magical potential in a liquid that\nis released with consumption, the effects are based on what the target believes it is\n(placebo), for any other it is just coloured water in a bottle. The magic is not perfect and\nshe can only create enough potential for minor potions.",
  "Pale Mornings": "One random PC wakes up with a giant tick attached to their neck. He/she looks very\npale and takes 1d4 +1 CON damage before the sleeper wakes up. Saves need to be made\nfor 2 random diseases.",
  "Pilgrimage": "A group of simply dressed peasants are led by a dwarf named Elfric in garb that marks\nhim is a cleric of the god(ess) of travel/cities. They were tasked to start a pilgrimage to\na new holy place and start a community out there. The party is welcome to travel with\nthem as long as they like. These pilgrims travel 12 hours a day but do not get exhausted\nand the same goes for the party if they travel along, this gets them forward at a steady\npace. If the party departs Elfric will bless them, making them immune to exhaustion for\na day.",
  "Poaching": "There is roaring and thrashing from somewhere off-road. A wounded griffon (or wyvern)\nis trapped in some poachers' device and her left wing is damaged by some sort of bear\nclaw device connected to a chain. The chain is locked and hammered into a tree stump,\nnext to it lays the carcass of a goat that was probably used to lure her here. The creature\nis very wary and will attack any humanoid on sight if it weren't for her chain radius of\n40 ft. Freeing her is not easy as she distrusts everything around her now. This is\nreinforced the moment someone tries to remove the chain as arrows fly from the\nshrubbery and the poachers return for their trophy, this turns the beast hostile again.",
  "Predator and Prey": "A moderate perception check spots over a dozen giant centipedes curled around trees,\nhalf hidden under leaves, and crawled around rocks, their antennae tasting the air\naround them. They are waiting for new prey. A skill challenge involving stealth and\ncreative thinking is needed to avoid the 3d4 +9 giant centipedes (groups of 4 in initiative,\nhalf of them arrive in the second round) to crawl from the woodworks and dive upon\ntheir fresh diner.",
  "Prison Transport": "You are passed by a huge caged cart accompanied by 8 soldiers and their captain.\nCaptain Rosh is transporting 5 prisoners (commoners) to the city (one of the prisoners\nmight be a NPC the party knows!). About 2 minutes after they pass you a group of 5\nriders (bandits) in leather with scarves around their faces pass you, they are loading\ncrossbows and reading swords. They aim to kill one of the prisoners so he is unable to\ntalk or be tortured for information, he is some runner for some criminal organization.",
  "Professional Banditry": "Ambush by 6 bandits and their barbarian goliath companion. They use the strength\nand mass of the goliath to split the party up by letting him jump in the middle and start\nsmashing around wildly (can attack all creatures in its range that are surprised with a\ndisadvantage, functions more to scare than be effective). The rest of the bandits will not\nreveal themselves in the first surprise round, rather they will wait for party to split and\n4 of them will run for the same PC (surprising him/her) while the other two will aid the\ngoliath. Their whole strategy is based on them grabbing a weaker/important member of\nthe group and get him/her pinned down so they can force the party to stop fighting or\nthey slit the throat (coup de grace mechanic) of this creature. They will demand\nsurrender by throwing all their weapons, food, and valuables on a pile. They will take all\nthe food and gold, and each ambusher may pick a weapon in return for leaving his own\nbehind (they have no magical knowledge, and will act accordingly) These are\nprofessionals and the whole affair is very civilised.",
  "Punishment and the Crime": "A man hangs from his arms from a large tree, the chains with which he is suspended\nseem sturdy and a small sign hangs from his neck; ''Sentenced to die for his crimes, any\nthat support him will suffer the same fate.''. Three soldiers are dragging a screaming\nwoman to the same tree, you see she dropped some sort of knife and is pleading for help.\nShe is the daughter of the chained half-dead man and came to finish his suffering but\ncouldn't, and when the soldiers saw her, they grabbed her and are planning to hang her\nnext to her father for interfering.",
  "River Spring": "Just of the road there is a short trail to a small pond. It is the spring of a rather large\nriver downstream, a water spirit (marid/nereid) lives here. She is very picky about who\nand what may take water from her spring. You must be clean, you must be nice, and\nyou must not stare at her delicate parts. Those that bring her suitable favours she will\nfill their water skin personally and turn it into a potion of (minor) healing. If any\nhostilities break out she will curse the perpetrators with thirst, water will turn to dust\nupon touching their lips, and flee through the spring.",
  "Runaway Steed": "A noble steed comes galloping over the road, the rider is nowhere to be seen. A\nskillchallenge is needed to stop this beast from running on and calming it down (3\nsuccesses before 2 fails). Saddlebags with a crest imbedded on them are filled with paper\ndocuments, a huge pouch of silver (425 sp), and some travelling rations. The saddle is\nalso engraved and probably worth a pretty penny. The horse was stolen from an estate\nand the rider was thrown off and killed by the horse. Everyone in the region would\nrecognise the crest.",
  "Shadowed": "The party may notice they ''caught'' something. An extra shadow on the road, a twisting\nshape in the firelight. It might not even be hostile at first, it will just need what it takes,\nand every night it will visit a party member and drains them for 1 strength point. It wants\nto reach a town or city, only then will it attempt to kill, as it now has a way to flee to\nothers.",
  "Shame Parade": "A group of kids follows you from the hamlet you just passed by. They are shooting berries\nat the party using improvised blowpipes (+7 to hit, 1 bludgeoning damage) and throwing\nstones (+4 to hit, 1d4 -1 damage). They have set some weird traps in the surrounding\nforest to get away when followed (sweeping branch dexterity save, which cuts movement\nfor that round on a success and deals 1d4 slashing damage on a fail).",
  "Shot the Messenger": "They find a messenger with an arrow through her leg. The message is important and the\nletter needs to be delivered as soon as possible, and she is unable to. She will ask\nsomeone to take that responsibility and deputises them by handing them a small silver\nfeather (the sign of the messenger guild). They get 1d4 +1 day to locate the recipient of\nthe letter (a NPC known by the PCs) and deliver it before they have to deliver it to a\ncorpse as the target will have been murdered without getting that warning letter. They\nmight be stalked by an assassin that wants to take that letter away as to help their\npartner get away with the murder of the target.",
  "Shrine of Safe Travels": "A small shrine to the goddess of protection and travelers stands at the roadside, a\nsimple grey stone altar with a holy symbol carved into it. On top there are several items,\na few silver coins in an ornate bowl, several candles, a ribbon tied to a wooden stick-\nfigure, a bouquet of dried healing herbs and a healing potion hidden near the base. A\nworthy offering gains them advantage on the next throw, if they are in dire need they\ncan take what they need from the shrine, taking something unnecessarily or desecrating\nthe shrine will gain them 1d4 times disadvantage.",
  "Silk Isn't No Game": "A textile merchant is hoping to relocate to another city. He will sell all kinds of coats,\nmasterwork backpacks, and even some fancy dresses. He will also sell expensive fabrics\nsuch as silk and satin from overseas, he even has 2 square meters of enchanted fabric,\nbut that will cost. He is transporting illegal silk worms (reason he got chased out of the\nlast city). He carries a rod of cold iron, as he and specifically his silk worms are hunted\nby silkweavers (2d4, phase spiders stats with damage reduction 3/cold iron).",
  "Sinkhole Season": "The road ahead is messed up and looks like it has been ploughed through several ways\nover. There is a nest of ankheg dug under the road, several chambers of which are\ndirectly under the road and function like sinkholes to drag creatures in. A creature\nfalling in one of these chambers needs to make a dexterity save and on a fail is stuck\nunder the collapsed earth and needs to free him/herself first, otherwise he/she is just\nprone on the bottom of a 10ft pit/underground chamber.",
  "Spirit of the Wild": "A huge elk (giant elk) struts onto the road, if there is a druid or ranger in the party it\nwill bow. A skilled hunter or opportunist might know a head of such a creature might\nfetch a really pretty penny. This is however a guardian of the region and will be defended\nby the forest if threatened (assassin vines, dire bear, entangle growth, a group of vicious\nsquirrels). If spoken to with respect in sylvan it might grant safe passage through this\nregion and a fortuitous road ahead, shaving some travel time off and the forest's aid in\nany further encounters in this region.",
  "Spirited Away": "You find a set of clothes on the road, next to a masterwork rapier, a small backpack with\ntravelling supplies, a good knife, a skin full of good wine, and silver necklace with the\nname igwine etched into it. There is no sign of the wearer or what happened to him but\nthe remnants of some arcane sigil in the road. A good 100 meters ahead there is another\nsuch sigil hidden below the dust of the road, this one is still active and the first creature\nin marching order with fey blood (such as elves) needs to make a high wisdom saving\nthrow or be turned into a puff of smoke that vaguely resembles their form. The puff of\nsmoke starts to drift on the wind deep into the wilderness if they cannot somehow\nprevent it from doing so. After an hour the spell will end, but if they couldn't stop\nhim/her they will end up in the lair of a very old night hag.",
  "Spooked": "The horses spook from something (worg smell) and start galloping along the road. They\nneed to be reined in as they flee into the surrounding environment. Each person on a\nhorse needs to complete a skill challenge: 3 successes needed before 5 fails or the horse\ntosses them and runs, each fail causes some kind of distress/damage to the rider.",
  "Stalked": "You are being stalked by a large pack of wolves, they will keep their distance but will\nbe present. They will follow the party for 1d4 days or until a weaker target makes itself\naware. If at some point a party member will seclude him/herself they will attack.",
  "Standoff": "When you visit a roadside inn you walk into a showdown between 2 bounty hunters\nand their quarry. The whole inn is tossed and tables lay on their sides, close to the door\na wounded (leg) bounty hunter winds his crossbow to shoot from cover assisting his\ncompanion that is now being boxed in from all sides. The three remaining half-orc\nmarauders are slowly flanking the bounty hunter that has sought cover behind a broken\ntable, a fourth half-orc lays dead in the center of the room with a crossbow bolt in an\neye socket. Regardless, the bounty hunters are clearly losing against their prey, but\nmaybe the players can shift the tide while negotiating about a percentage of the cut.",
  "Sticky Brandwick": "You encounter a traveling minstrel named Brandwick, he is all about pursuing his\npersonal dream of becoming a world-renowned bard. He will use all the magic in his\narsenal to become liked and loved and overstays all welcome. Upon meeting he will be\njovial, cast friendship on a party member, charm another, will make up a song about\nthe third, and gives a pouch with 10 gold to the most greedy looking PC. He will help in\nany way he can and will not take no for an answer but doesn't like to get his hands dirty.\nAs the party soon will find out he is really hard to get rid of, and whether it is bad luck\nor not he will turn up randomly in the same tavern, brothel, mayor's house, or prisoners\ncamp despite the best efforts of ridding themselves of him.",
  "Stranger on the Road": "A stranger on the road, her name is Brigitt and she is a tough cookie and plays a mean\nflute. She will tell horror stories about monsters that can change into men and ruin their\nlives, stories of someone she knew that was convicted of murder, something he didn't do\nbut everyone saw him do it. She is fleeing from her former life and she might let it slip\nthat this man was her brother. Upon departure she will ask the party for a bit of blessing\non the road and gives one of the PCs her flute, the PC may make a very difficult\nperception check to see her eyes have changed colour to match his. The name engraved\non the flute is ''Lariander''.

  "Svendor the Magnificent": "A small carriage stands near a fork in the road, huge curly letters on the side state\n''Svendor the Magnificent'' and in smaller letters ''Accomplished member of the Travelling\nWizard Guild.''. The backside of the carriage opens up into a counter which is manned\nby a lanky half elf carefully painting something on a piece of parchment and dusting it\nwith some colourless powder. He can sell the party any number of level 1 and several\nlevel 2 magic scrolls which he fetches from the back for the base price minus 5 gold\npieces. Hostile actions or attempts at robbery will end badly as the whole carriage\nvanishes from this plane into a pocket dimension, all creatures caught in the smoke this\nproduces (30 ft radius) will receive a magic mark on their face making them recognisable\nby any wizard or well-informed citizen.",
  "Tax Collector": "Tax collectors also make their rounds up here, you meet one and his entourage of 6 duke\nsoldiers.

  "The ''Wine'' Job": "You hear the sound of fighting and the whinnying of horses. A heavy cart pulled by two\nhorses appears to have suffered a broken axle, one of the barrels it was transporting has\nrolled off and broke.

You see a man riding a horse fleeing the scene at high speed, this is the merchant\nwho owns these barrels of ''wine''.",
  "The Brains and the Prophecy": "Meet Qimlock, a gnome hedge wizard, and Tere, a patient goliath warrior (monk). Tere\nhas received a vision from the elder of her tribe, which led her to Qimlock, a young gnome\nbound to be great. Tere is there to make sure this happens and to keep convincing\nQimlock that he is destined to do something great in the future, something to be sung\nabout in taverns around the country decades after the fact. She knows this is true.\nQimlock himself is young and knows he is no match for anything, but he is eager to\nimprove himself and wants to trade spells with other spellcasters in the party. A quick\nlook at his spellbook will let you know that this kid is beyond brilliant and he in fact\ninvented several spells himself, for example; Level 1 Umbrella, prevents any diminutive\nwater-based fluid from entering a 20 ft static sphere.",
  "The Long Game": "A single goblin stands in the road, her name is Bait and she demands 20 gold pieces for\npassage. A moderate perception check will show the presence of 6 others in the bushes\nin cover. Upon hostile action one of the goblins in the bushes will cast entangle and all\ngoblins will bolt. Later that night the goblins will return in force with advantage on their\nstealth checks to approach the camp as they carry a stone with them on which silence\nis cast. The guard may notice something being tossed in camp; the stone in the fire. The\nresulting silence will prevent the guard from screaming out and waking the others as 10\ngoblins jump them. Five will go for all the lose equipment in camp and bail with it, the\nothers will slit PCs throats (coup de grace if they sleep) and attempt to kill them quickly\nin the silence bubble.

When you get closer you see\nthere is a wounded and unconscious man laying under one of its huge paws dressed in\nlively garb, three other men colour the road with their own entrails.

  "The Spear in Amber": "The trunk of an ancient tree patiently awaits at the side of the road. A large spear is\njammed into the centre of the trunk and is encased in a soft glowing amber. Edged in\nthe wood around the spear tip are the words ''She who knows my name may wield me\nonce again.'' in sylvan. While druidcraft seems to do something, the tree seems to resist\nmagic. Any rough violence will draw out 4 dryads from the surroundings to protect the\nancient sight.",
  "The Unburied": "You wander upon two corpses slain in the middle of the road. Both appear to be simple\ntravelers and their backpacks and other valuables appear to be missing.

  "The White Fox": "A white fox is spotted twice over the course of an hour. An appropriate check might\nreveal it to be a magical beast of sorts. If followed it will bring the party to a sacred grove\nfilled with clarity, peace and abundant flora. Several bushes with goodberries grow in\nthe shade of a large white willow. Staying for a long rest here will shed them of 1d4\nnegative effects they currently experience as well as give them 5 temporary hitpoints.

She lost her mom\nand her dad who are travelling to the big city. She will follow the most non-cuddly\ncharacter around, and generally will attempt to join the party. That night she will cuddle\nup to whomever allows it as she is cold and alone. During the night she will bite and\ndrain her cuddle partner to an inch of his/her life (accepting the cuddling equals failing\nher charm), she is a 131-year-old vampire and this is her scam.

After 4\nrounds the normal ants start to dissolve their lines and will gang up with 2d10 each\nround.",
  "Troll-ish": "You meet Domp the troll just while he is busy removing a small tree from the road. He\nis friendly but his common is not very good and he will stereotype all travelers. All with\nmetal armour are knights, all with bows are either hunters if human or elves if not\nhuman, everything in robes is a wizard. He is fascinated by magic and will take that as\nproper toll for his maintenance of this road, otherwise he will ask for something small\nand useful and he will not take coins.",

  "Unfaithful Stories": "You stumble upon an abandoned camp next to a large boulder, a smothered campfire\nand a still rolled sleeping bag lay next to it. Those that investigate might find the ashes\nstill slightly warm and wet from a recent drowning and the grass is indented around the\nplace as if someone was present recently. No trails leave the camp though. Detect magic\nmight reveal that there is something off with the boulder but that it is not alive. Patience\nmight be rewarded by a scrawny figure emerging magically from the boulder where he\nattempted to hide.

He will use tremorsense against invisible opponents and other\nsneakiness. Creativity is key.",
  "Violet Creepers": "The plants in this clearing that the road runs through are not what they seem. The\nplants produce some sort of volatile chemical that requires a moderate wisdom save or\nwill put targets to sleep for 1d4 hours. Unconscious creatures are detected and pulled\nof the road by vines (assassins vine) and are slowly strangled over the course of minutes\nand are swallowed whole by the shrubbery. If any AoE attacks are used that produce\ndamage the whole shrubbery shrivels up and forms a shambling mound that carries\nunconscious creatures as humanoid shields.",
  "Wandering Flora": "The road ahead is overrun with 2d4 yellow musk zombies, you can see them stumbling\nabout. If one is attacked 3d4 +4 start to stumble from the woods one by one from both\nsides.

  "Washed Away": "A deep creek splits the road in two, the wooden beams that once formed a bridge have\nbeen washed away in a recent storm. Several locals on the other side of the creek are\nalso searching for a solution to cross with their cart. The current is strong and it is too\ndeep to cross with a horse but the stream is only 40 ft wide.",
  "Whispering Stones": "The roads wind between a series of small hills. Weirdly shaped old black stones cover\ntheir surfaces. The winds play tricks on you here and the voices you hear may not be as\nsolid as you might think. It is a mysterious place. Each PC might receive 1 or 2 personal\nwhispers, something that might or might not be true but something only the world could\nknow (something about family being alive, or tribes being hunted and killed). The spirits\nhere represent something ancient and they are mirrors of one's soul, if a character is\nvengeful the spirits will mirror this in their whispers.",
  "Whistle Twice": "A creature with clear fey ancestry sits on the side of the road on a stone, he will waive\nthe party over. He is eating a piece of fruit and asks them if they want to pass safely,\nbecause he knows how. He will sell them the answer for 3 good gifts. If they do give him\nthree good gifts he will learn them a whistle that they have to perform well when they\nsee an old oak tree. If they don't whistle at the oak two arrows fly from the side of the\nroad (+8 to hit, 1d6 + 3 piercing damage), targets are those not wearing armour. The oak\ntree houses a dryad and is protected by some fey, the first fey is just scamming travelers\nfor gifts.",
  "Wrong Turn": "The road bends off to the left. A trained eye or a detailed map would reveal the overgrown\nroad straight ahead, covered in hastily grown shrubs and small trees. Part of this is\nforest is craft and part (the larger trees) are illusions. The new road leads to a small grove\nwith three small houses of loggers with a tiny farm. Three families live there, the wives\nof which are all hags, the husbands are brainwashed commoners, one of the daughters\nis quite the powerful witch in training. The hags need fresh blood and the trick with the\nroad is their way to get victims.",
  "Wrong Way Around": "A small caravan of peasants and traders pass you by, the oxen of their last cart is being\nobnoxious, delaying their travel. They greet you and a woman on the second cart will\nask if you want to buy some stuff, particularly the wine is good this year. It takes a\nproper sense motive or perception check to notice something is up, the peasants (8\nbandits + 2 warlocks) are wearing leather under their clothes and they seem rather\nnervous and on edge. A soon as they approach the woman on the cart the first and the\nthird cart will be pulled sideways to block the road and box them in, weapons appear\nfrom under bushels and canvas. The woman will demand surrender of their gold and\nvaluables and drop their weapons to the ground (using suggestion to do it as she is a\nwarlock) if they want to live another hour.",
  "Young Fun": "Near a small hamlet three kids are playing next to the road. Two are standing under a\nlarge oak while the third is climbing it to reach a nest of eggs. It seems dangerous as the\nnest is quite high up, but the kid is determined. Interference is an option and several\nscenarios might occur; He climbs too far up in the thin branches and will fall, he climbs\nup but doesn't dare to come back down, the couple of crows of whom the nest is come\nback and will attack him defending the nest. If something bad is prevented their parents\nwill offer free dinner, a place to sleep warm, and a blueberry pie for on the road."
